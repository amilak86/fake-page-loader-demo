# Fake Page Loader Demo

This is a sample implementation using [FakeLoader.js](https://github.com/joaopereirawd/fakeLoader.js/) Javascript library for displaying a page loading effect on a web page. The page also utilizes [deelay.me](http://deelay.me/) delay proxy to intentionally delay the loading of an image used in the page so that you can clearly see the page loading effect at work.
